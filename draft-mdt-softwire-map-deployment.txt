Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


1.  Introduction

   IPv4 address exhaustion has becoming world-wide reality and the main
   stream of deployment since now on is IPv6-only networking.
   Meanwhile, having access to legacy IPv4 contents and services is a
   long-term requirement, lasting until the completion of the IPv6
   transition.  It demands sharing residual IPv4 address pools for IPv4
   communications across the IPv6-only domain(s).

   Mapping of Address and Port (MAP)
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port] is designed in response
   to the requirement of stateless residual deployment.  The term
   "residual deployment" refers to utilizing not-yet-assigned or
   recalled IPv4 addresses for IPv4 communications going across the IPv6
   domain backbone.  MAP assumes the IPv6-only backbone as the
   prerequisite of deployment so that native IPv6 services and
   applications are fully supported and encouraged.  The statelessness
   of MAP ensures only moderate overhead is added to part of the network
   devices.

   Residual deployment with MAP is new to most operators.  This document
   is motivated to provide basic understanding on the usage of MAP,
   i.e., when and how an operator can do with MAP to meet its own
   operational requirements of IPv6 transition and its facility
   conditions, in the phase of IPv4 residual deployment.  Potential
   readers of this document are those who want to know:

   1.  What kind of deployment requirements does MAP satisfy?

   2.  What technical options needs to be considered when deploying MAP,
       and how?

   3.  How does MAP impact on the address planning for both IPv6 and
       IPv4 pools?

   4.  How does MAP impact on daily network operations and
       administrations?

   5.  How do we migrate to IPv6-only network with the help of MAP?

   Terminology of this document, unless it is intentionally specified,
   follows the definitions and abbreviations of
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port]. (> co-authors: we may
   change this if later we find any new terms need to be added.)

3.  Case Studies

   MAP is suitable for deployment either in large-scale carrier (fixed)
   networks or in mobile networks.  They have similar but different
   requirements.

3.1.  Fixed networks

   There are typically two network models for fixed broadband access
   service: one is to access using PPPoE/PPPoA authentication method
   while the other is to use IPoE.  The first one is usually applied to
   Residential network and SOHO networks.  Subscribers in CPNs can
   access broadband network by PPP dial-up authentication.  BRAS is the
   key network element which takes full responsibility of IP address
   assignment, user authentication, traffic aggregation, PPP session
   termination, etc.  Then IP traffic is forwarded to Core Routers
   through Metro Area Network, and finally transited to external
   Internet via Backbone network.The second network scenario is usually
   applied to large enterprise networks.  Subscribers in CPNs can access
   broadband network by IPoE authentication.  IP address is normally
   assigned by DHCP server, or static configuration.

   In either case, a CPE could obtain a prefix via prefix delegation
   procedure, and the hosts behind CPE would get its own IPv6 addresses
   within the prefix through SLAAC or DHCPv6 stateful.  A MAP CE would
   also obtain a set of MAP rules from DHCPv6 server.  In MAP solution,
   both encapsulation and double translation can be applied.

3.2.  Mobile networks

   Regarding the MAP based solution, double translation is more suitable
   in mobile environment according to the analysis in stateless
   4V6[I-D.dec-stateless-4v6].  An architecture of mobile network
   deploying MAP-based solutions is depicted in
   [I-D.chen-softwire-4v6-pd].  UE could take the rule of MAP CE.  There
   may be three possible cases for a UE performing as a MAP CE.  As
   shown in Figure 1.  It provides IPv4 only, IPv6 only or IPv6 and IPv4
   connection to IP devices depicted as H1, H2 and H3.  The MAP CE may
   implement a internal NAT44 to provide IPv4 connectin for multiple IP
   devices.  The IP devices get /64 prefix from MAP CE through RS/RA.
   Such a /64 prefix is generated from the prefix assigned by the
   network through prefix delegation.  In the process, IPv6 prefix
   delegation is asked to derive the shared IPv4 address implicitly.

   Prefix delegation is introduced in 3GPP network in Release 10.  A MAP
   CE obtains IPv6 prefix from the mobile network.  It then initiates
   DHCPv6 for prefix delegation.  There are two phases for a MAP CE
   performs prefix delegation function.  For the first phase, the MAP CE
   attaches to the LTE network.  The network provides the UE with IPv6
   only connection and the UE obtains a /64 rule IPv6 prefix.  For the
   second phase, the MAP CE initiates prefix delegation procedure.  The
   network assign a prefix shorter than 64 to the CE.  Figure 1 shows a
   case that a /56 is assigned to MAP CE during prefix delegation.

4.  Deployment Consideration

4.1.  Building the MAP domain

   When deploying stateless MAP in operational network, a provider
   should firstly do MAP domain planning based on its own network
   condition.  According to the definition of
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port], a MAP domain is a set of
   MAP CEs and BRs connected to the same virtual link.  One MAP domain
   share a common BR and have the same set of BMRs, FMRs and DMR, and it
   can be further divided into multiple sub-domains when multiple IPv4
   subnets are deployed in one MAP domain.  All CEs in MAP domain are
   provisioned with the same set of MAP rules by MAP DHCPv6 server
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option].  There might be multiple BMRs in
   one MAP domain, and CE would pick up its own BMR by best prefix
   matching lookup.  However, all CEs within the sub-domain will have
   the same BMR. in which the BMR of all CEs is the same.  In hub&spoke
   mode, CE would use DMR as its only FMR for outbound traffic; while in
   mesh mode, a best matching prefix lookup is done in the IPv4 routing
   tabe and the correct FMR is chosen.

   Basically, operator should firstly determine its own deployment mode
   for MAP domain: mesh or Hub &spoke, as different considerations for
   different deployment models should be applied accordingly.
   Afterwards, MAP domain planning, MAP rule provision, addressing and
   routing, etc., for a MAP domain should be taken into consideration.

4.1.1.  Mesh vs. Hub/Spoke

   Only Hub/spoke communications can be achieved among CEs located
   different MAP domains.  Mesh or Hub/Spoke communications can be
   achieved among CEs in one MAP domain in terms of assigning
   appropriate Forwarding Mapping Rule(s) (FMR(s)) to CEs.

   It is note that Default Mapping Rule (DMR) must be assigned to all
   CEs in MAP domain as FMR or one of FMRs.

   The decision to choose Mesh or Hub&Spoke depends on operator's
   network policy.  In Hub&Spoke mode, all traffic within the same MAP
   domain has to go through BR which will result in less optimized
   traffic; however, it would simplify the CE process since there is no
   need to do FMR lookup for each incoming packet.  Besides, it would
   have enhanced management ability as BR can take full control of all
   the traffic.  As a result, it is reasonable to deploy Hub&Spoke mode
   for network with relatively flat architecture.

   In mesh mode, traffic optimization can be achieved by CE to CE direct
   path.  It is recommended to apply mesh mode in case CE to CE traffic

   occupies a large amount and there are not too many MAP rules, say
   less than 10 MAP rules, in the specific domain.

4.1.1.1.  Only Hub/Spoke Communication among CEs

   Only assigning DMR to all CEs as FMR, Hub&Spoke communication can be
   achieved between all CEs.  In this mode, when CE send packets to
   other CE in the same MAP domain, the packets must go though BR before
   arriving the peer.

4.1.1.2.  Only Mesh Communication among CEs

   Assigning all BMRs in MAP domain to each CE as FMRs, Mesh
   communications can be achieved among all CEs.  In this case, when CE
   receive IPv4 packets, it looks up appropriate FMR with a specific
   Rule IPv4 prefix which has the longest match with an IPv4 destination
   address.  If the FMR is found (destination is one of CEs in the MAP
   domain), the packets will be forwarded to associated CE directly
   without going though BR.  If the FMR is no found (destination is out
   of the MAP domain), the DMR will be selected as FMR, then forward the
   packets to associated BR(s).

4.1.1.3.  Mesh or Hub/Spoke communication among some CEs (title? TBD)

   Mesh communications among some CEs along with Hub/Spoke
   communications among some other CEs can be achieved by which
   differentiated FMRs are assigned to CEs.  For instant, as Figure 1
   shown, Mapping rule 1, Mapping rule 2, Mapping rule 3 is provisioned
   to CE1, CE2, CE3 respectively as BMR, DMR and rule 1 and rule2, DMR
   and rule 1 and rule 2 and rule 3, DMR and rule 2 and rule 3 are
   assigned to CE1, CE2, CE3 respectively, then CE1 and CE2, CE2 and CE3
   communicate directly without going though associated BR (Mesh mode),
   the communication between CE1 and CE3 must go though BR before
   reaching peer each other (Hub/Spoke mode).

4.1.2.  MAP domain planning

   Stateless MAP has its own advantage in terms of scalability, high-
   reliability, etc.  As a result, it is reasonable to apply a larger
   MAP domain to accomodate more subscribers with less BRs.  Moreover, a
   larger MAP domain would also be easier for management and
   maintainace.  However, a larger MAP domain may also result in less
   optimized traffic in Hub & spoke case, where all traffic has to go
   through a remote BR.  Besides, it will also result in increased
   number of MAP rules and highly centralized address mangement, etc.
   It is a tradeoff to choose an appropriate domain coverage.

   Generally speaking, it is not recommended to use a large MAP domain
   in Hub & spoke model.  While in mesh model, it is suggested to adopt
   a relatively larger MAP domain since traffic optimization has already
   been guaranteed, and the only concern is to make sure that the number
   of MAP rules is not too many.

   Furthermore, MAP sub-domains can be divided for differentiated
   service provision.  Different sub-domains could be distinguished by
   different Rule IPv4 prefixes.  But all CEs within the same MAP sub-
   domain would have the same Rule IPv4 prefix, Rule IPv6 prefix and
   PSID.

4.1.3.  MAP rule provisioning

   All the CEs within a MAP domain will get the same set of MAP rules by
   DHCPv6 server, including BMR, FMRs and DMR.  In one MAP domian, BMR
   for different CEs might be different, but FMRs and DMR are all the
   same.  Each Mapping Rule keeps a record of Rule IPv6 prefix, Rule
   IPv4 prefix, Rule EA-bits length and Rule Port Parameters.  Section
   XX would give a step by step example of how to calculate these
   parameters.

   In stateless MAP, the deployment of DHCPv6 server is independent with

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   MAP domain planning.  So there are three possible ways:

4.1.3.1.  MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = 1:1

   This is the ideal solution that each MAP domain would have its own
   MAP DHCPv6 server.  In this case, MAP DHCPv6 server only needs to
   configure parameters for the specific MAP domain.  It is highly
   recommended to adopt this deployment model in stateless MAP.

4.1.3.2.  MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = 1:N

   This might happen when DHCPv6 server is distributely deployed in a
   large MAP domain.  In this case, all these DHCPv6 server should
   configure the same set of MAP rules for its MAP domain, including
   mutiple BMRs, FMRs and DMR.

4.1.3.3.  MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = N:1

   This might happen when MAP domain is relatively small and MAP DHCPv6
   server is deployed centralized in the network.  It would be
   complicated since DHCPv6 server needs to distinguish between
   different MAP domains and assign appropriate MAP rules for CEs.  It
   is not suggested to use this deployment model unless there are easy
   way, e.g.  ACL, etc., to identify different MAP domains.

   Discussion: Is there some possible easy way to idenfity different MAP
   domains ?

   Besides, the situation of remaining IPv4 address prefixes may have
   big impact on MAP rule planning, especially for service operators who
   only have rather scattered address space.  Since the number of
   scattered IPv4 address prefixes would be equal to the number of FMR
   rules within a MAP domain, one should choose as large IPv4 address
   pool as possible to reduce the number of FMR rules.

4.1.4.  PSID consideration

   For PSID provnisioning, all the CEs, BR and DHCPv6 server within the
   same MAP domain should be configured with the same parameter value.
   All CEs with the same BMR should have the same PSID length.  If a
   provider would like to introduce differentiated address sharing
   ratios for different CEs, it is better to define multiple MAP sub-
   domains with different Rule IPv4 prefixes.  In this way, MAP domain
   division is only a logical method, rather than a geographical one.

   The default PSID offset is chosen as 4 in
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port], which will exclude port
   range of 0-4096.  Operator can adjust the value follow practical



Chen, et al.             Expires August 2, 2012                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   usage in reality.

   With regard to PSID format, both continous and non-continuous port
   set can be supported in GMA algorithm.  Although non-continuous port
   set has the advantage of better security, UPnP friendly, etc.,
   continuous port set is still the simplest way to implement.  Since
   PSID format should be supported not only in CPEs, BRs and DHCPv6
   server, but also in other supporting systems as well, e.g. traffic
   logging system, user management system, a provider should make the
   decision based on an comprehensive analysis on its own existing
   systems.

4.1.5.  Addressing and routing

   In MAP addressing, it should follow the MAP rule planning in the MAP
   domain.

   For IPv4 addressing, since the number of scattered IPv4 address
   prefixes would be equal to the number of FMR rules within a MAP
   domain, one should choose as large IPv4 address pool as possible to
   reduce the number of FMR rules.For IPv6 address, the Rule IPv6
   prefixes should be equal to the end user IPv6 prefix in MAP domain.

   For MAP routing, since it has already prohibited IPv4 routing
   imported in IPv6, there will be no more impact on IPv6 routing
   anymore.

4.1.6.  Translation vs. Encapsulation

   TBD

4.2.  BR settings

   1.  BR placement

   BR placement has important impacts on the operation of a MAP domain.

   A first concern should be the avoidance of "triangle routing".  That
   is, the path from the CE to an IPv4 peer via the BR should be close
   to the one that would be taken if the CE had native IPv4
   connectivity.  This can be accomplished easily by placing the BR
   close to the CE, such that the length of the path from the CE to the
   BR is minimized.

   However, minimizing the CE-BR path would ignore a second concern,
   that of minimizing IPv4 operations.  An ISP deploying MAP will
   probably want to focus on IPv6 operations, while keeping IPv4
   operational expenditures to a minimum.  This would imply that the



Chen, et al.             Expires August 2, 2012                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   size of the IPv4 network that the ISP has to administer would be kept
   to a minimum.  Placing the BR near the CE means that the length of
   the IPv4 network between the BR and the IPv4 Internet would be
   maximal.

   Moreover, in case where the set of CEs is geographically dispersed,
   multiple BRs would be needed, which would further enlarge the IPv4
   network that the ISP has to maintain.

   Therefore, we offer the following guideline: BRs should be placed as
   close to the border with the IPv4 Internet as possible while keeping
   triangle routing to a minimum.  Regional POPs should probably be
   considered as potential candidates.

   Note also that MAP being stateless, asymmetric routing is possible,
   meaning that separate BRs can be used for traffic entering and
   exiting a MAP domain.  This option can be considered for its effects
   on traffic engineering.

   Anycast can be used to let the network pick BR closest to a CE for
   traffic exiting the MAP domain.  This is accomplished by provisioning
   a Default Mapping Rule containing an anycast IPv6 address or prefix.
   Operationally, this allows incremental deployment of BRs in strategic
   locations without modifying the provisioning system's configuration.
   CE's close to a newly-deployed BR will automatically start using it.

   2.  Reliability Considerations

   Reliability of MAP is derived in major part from its statelessness.
   This means that MAP can benefit from the usual methods of Internet
   reliability.

   Anycast, already mentioned in section 4.2.1, can be used to ensure
   reliability of traffic from CE to BR.  Since there can be only one
   Default Mapping Rule per MAP domain, traffic from CE to BR will
   always use the same destination address (in encapsulation mode) or
   prefix (in translation mode).  When this is address or prefix is
   anycast, reliability is greatly increased.  If a BR goes down, it
   stops advertising the IPv6 anycast address or prefix, and traffic is
   automatically re-routed to other BRs.  For this mechanism to work
   correctly, it is crucial that the anycast route announcement be very
   closely tied to BR availability.  See [RFC4786] for best current
   practices on the operation of anycast services.

   Anycast covers global reliability.  Reliability within a single link
   can be achieved with the help of a redundancy protocol such as VRRP
   [RFC5798].  This allows operation of a pair of BRs in active/standby
   configuration.  No state needs to be shared for the operation of MAP,



Chen, et al.             Expires August 2, 2012                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   so there is no need to keep the standby node in a "warm" state: as
   long as it is up and ready to take over the virtual IPv6 address,
   quick failover can be achieved.  This makes the pair behave as a
   single, much more reliable node, with less reliance on quick routing
   protocol convergence for reliability.

   It is expected that production-quality MAP deployments will make use
   of both anycast and a redundancy protocol such as VRRP.

   3.  MTU/Fragmentation

   If the MTU is well-managed such that the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN side
   interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs within the boundary
   of the MAP domain, then the 4rd Tunnel MTU can be set to the known
   IPv6 MTU minus the size of the encapsulating IPv6 header (40 bytes).
   For example, if the IPv6 MTU is known to be 1500 bytes, the 4rd
   Tunnel MTU might be set to 1460 bytes.  Absent more specific
   information, the 4rd Tunnel MTU SHOULD default to 1280 bytes.

   When using encapsulation mode, it is important that fragments of a
   MAP packet sent according to the Default Mapping Rule be handled by
   the same BR.  (This is not required for translation mode.)  This can
   be a problem when using an anycast BR address and routing
   fluctuations cause fragments of a packet to be routed to multiple
   BRs.

   BRs using an anycast address as source can cause problems.  If
   traffic sent by a BR with a source anycast address causes an ICMP
   error to be returned, that error packet's destination address will be
   an anycast address, meaning that a different BR could receive it.  In
   the case of a Too Big ICMP error, this could cause a path MTU
   discovery black hole.  Another possible problem could occur if
   fragmented packets from different BRs using the same anycast address
   as source happen to contain the same fragment ID.  This would break
   fragment reassembly.

   Therefore, when using anycast addresses, it is RECOMMENDED that they
   be only used as destination addresses, and never as source addresses.
   BRs SHOULD be configured to accept traffic sent to the anycast
   address, but use an unicast address as source.

   In MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are not shared, IPv6 destinations
   are derived from IPv4 addresses alone.  Thus, each IPv4 packet can be
   encapsulated and decapsulated independently of each other. 4rd
   processing is completely stateless.

   On the other hand, in MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are shared,
   BRs and CEs may have to encapsulate or translate IPv4 packets whose



Chen, et al.             Expires August 2, 2012                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   IPv6 destinations depend on destination ports.  Precautions are
   needed, due to the fact that the destination port of a fragmented
   datagram is available only in its first fragment.  A sufficient
   precaution consists in reassembling each datagram received in
   multiple packets, and to treat it as though it would have been
   received in single packet.  This function is such that MAP is in this
   case stateful at the IP layer.  (This is common with DS-lite and
   NAT64/DNS64 which, in addition, are stateful at the transport layer.)
   At domain entrance, this ensures that all pieces of all received IPv4
   datagrams go to the right IPv6 destinations.

   Another peculiarity of shared IPv4 addresses is that, without
   precaution, a destination could simultaneously receive from different
   sources fragmented datagrams that have the same Datagram ID (the
   Identification field of [RFC0791]).  This would disturb the
   reassembly process.  To eliminate this risk, CE MUST rewrite the
   datagram ID to a unique value among CEs sharing an IPv4 address upon
   sending the packet over a MAP domain.  This value SHOULD be generated
   locally within the port-range assigned to a given CE.  Note that
   replacing a Datagram ID in an IPv4 header implies an update of its
   Header-checksum field, by adding to it the one's complement
   difference between the old and the new values.

4.3.  CE settings

   1. bridging vs. routing mode

   In routing mode, the CE runs a standard NAT44 [RFC3022] using the
   allocated public address as external IP and ports via DHCPv6 option.
   When receiving an IPv4 packet with private source address from its
   end hosts, it performs NAT44 function by translating the source
   address into public and selecting a port from the allocated port-set.
   Then it encapsulates/translates the packet with the concentrator's
   IPv6 address as destination IPv6 address, and forwards it to the
   concentrator.  When receiving an IPv6 packet from the concentrator,
   the initiator decapsulates/translates the IPv6 packet to get the IPv4
   packet with public destination IPv4 address.  Then it performs NAT44
   function and translates the destination address into private.

   The CE is responsible for performing ALG functions (e.g., SIP, FTP),
   as well as supporting NAT Traversal mechanisms (e.g., UPnP, NAT-PMP,
   manual mapping configuration).  This is no different from the
   standard IPv4 NAT today.

   For the bridging mode, end host would run a software performing CE
   functionalities.  In this case, end host gets public address
   directly.  It is also suggested that the host run a local NAT to map
   randomly generated ports into the restricted, valid port-set.



Chen, et al.             Expires August 2, 2012                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   Another solution is to have the IP stack to only assign ports within
   the restricted, valid range to applications.  Either way the host
   guarantees that every source port number in the outgoing packets
   falls into the allocated port-set.

   2.  CE-initiated application

   CE-initiated case is applied for situations where applications run on
   CE directly.  If the application in CE use the public address
   directly, it might conflict with other CEs.  So it is highly
   suggested that CE should also run a local NAT to map a private
   address to public address in CE.  In this way, the CE IPv4 address
   passed to local applications would be conflict with other CEs.
   Moreover, CE should guarantee that every source port number in the
   outgoing packets falls into the allocated port-set.

5.  MAP Address Planning, a Step-by-step Guide

   This section is purposed to provide a referential guidance to
   operators, illustrating a common fashion of address planning with MAP
   in IPv4 residual deployment.

   Residual deployment starts from IPv6 address planning.  A simple
   example is taken inline for easy understanding.

   (A) IPv6 considerations

   (A1)  Determine the maximum number N of CEs to be supported, and, for
         generality, suppose N = 2^n.

         For example, we suppose n = 20.  It means there will be up to
         about one million CEs.

   (A2)  Choose the length x of IPv6 prefixes to be assigned to ordinary
         customers.

         Considering we have a /32 IPv6 block, it is not a problem for
         the IPv6 deployment with the given number of CEs.  Let x = 60,
         allowing subnets inside in each CE delegated networks.

   (A3)  Multiply N by a margin coefficient K, a power of two (K = 2 ^
         k), to take into account that:

      -  Some privileged customers may be assigned IPv6 prefixes of
         length x', shorter than x, to have larger addressing spaces
         than ordinary customers, both in IPv6 and IPv4;

      -  Due to the hierarchy of routable prefixes, many theoretically
         delegatable prefixes may not be actually delegatable (ref: host
         density ratio of [RFC3194]).

         In our example, let's take k = 0 for simplicity.

   (B) IPv4 considerations

   (B1)  List all (non overlapping, not yet assigned to any in-running
         networks) IPv4 prefixes Hi that are available for IPv4 residual
         deployment.

         Suppose that we hold two blocks and not yet assigned to any
         fixed network: 192.32../16 and 63.245../16.






Chen, et al.             Expires August 2, 2012                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   (B2)  Take enough of them, among the shortest ones, to get a total
         whose size M is a power of two (M = 2 ^ m), and includes a good
         proportion of the available IPv4 space.

         If we use both blocks, M = 2^16 + 2^16, and therefore m = 17.
         Then PSID length could be 3 bits, the corresponding sharing
         ratio is also determined so that each CE can have 8192 ports to
         use under the shared global IPv4 address.

   (B3)  For each IPv4 prefix Hi of length hi, choose a "rule index",
         i.e., the 4pfx in Fig.C-1 and Fig.C-3, say Ri of length ri = m
         - (32 - hi).

         All these indexes must be non overlapping prefixes (e.g. 0, 10,
         110, 111 for one /10, one /11, and two /12).

         Then we have:

             H1 = 192.32../16, h1 = 16, r1 = 1 => R1 = bin(0);
             H2 = 63.245../16, h2 = 16, r2 = 1 => R2 = bin(1);

   (C) After (A) and (B), derive the rule(s)

   (C1)  Derive the length c of the "Common prefix" C that will appear
         at the beginning of all delegated prefixes (c = x - (n + k)).

   (C2)  Take any prefix for this C of length c that starts with a RIR-
         allocated IPv6 prefix.

   (C3)  For each IPv4 prefix Hi, make a rule, in which the key is Hi,
         and the value is the Common prefix C followed by the Rule index
         Ri.  Then this i-th rule's Rule IPv6 Prefix will have the
         length of (c + ri).

         Then we can do that:

               c = 40 => C = 2001:0db8:ff00::/40
               Rule 1: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff00::/41
               Rule 2: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41

         As a result, for a certain CE delegating 2001:0db8:ff98:
         7650::/60, its parameters are:

              Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41 => Rule 2
              IPv4 Suffix = bin(001 1000 0111 0110 0)
                                         PSID = bin(101) = 0x5
              Rule IPv4 Prefix = 63.245../16
              CE IPv4 Address = 63.245.48.236

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   If different sharing ratio is demanded, we may partition CEs into
   groups and do (A) and (B) for each group, determining the PSID length
   for them separately.

   Remarks:

   1.  IPv6 address planning in residual deployment is independent of
       the usage of the residual IPv4 addresses.

   2.  The IPv4 address pool for "residual deployment" contains IPv4
       addresses not yet assigned to customers/subscribers and/or those
       already recalled from ex-customers.  Dynamic assignment is also
       considered of the case of "recalled".

   3.  MAP is mainly designed for residual deployment but also applied
       for the case of legacy IPv4 networks keeping communication with
       the IPv4 world over the IPv6 domain without renumbering.  In such
       a case, unlike the residual deployment, the IPv6 addressing is
       not independent of IPv4.

   4.  For the non-residual deployment case, the address format, which
       is introduced by [RFC6052] as well as its extensions like
       [I-D.xli-behave-divi], is typically applied.  The relevance of
       MAP- and RFC6052-formats is: once a single rule applies for the
       whole IPv4 space, MAP-format becomes equivalent to RFC6052-
       format.  This frees the domain to distribute any specific rule
       information, including the DMR.

6.  Migration Methodology

6.1.  Roadmap for MAP-based Solution

6.1.1.  Start from Scratch

   IPv6 deployment normally involves a step-wise approach where parts of
   the network should properly updated gradually.  As IPv6 deployment
   progresses it may be simpler for operators to employ a single-version
   network, since deploying both IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel would costs
   more than IPv6-only network.  Therefore switching to an IPv6-only
   network in realtively small scale will become more prevalent.
   Meanwhile, a significant part of network will still stay in IPv4 for
   long time, especially at early stage of IPv6 transition.  There may
   not be enough public or private IPv4 addresses to support end-to-end
   network communication, without segmenting the network into small
   parts with sharing one IPv4 address space.  That is a time to
   introduce MAP-based solution to bridge these IPv4 islands through
   IPv6 network.

6.1.2.  Coexiting Phases

   SP has various deployment strategy in the wild.  The deployment of
   MAP-based solution(i.e.  MAP-encapsulation and MAP-translation)
   should have a big tolerance to allow different deployment modes to be
   occuring.  Coexisting deployment would be a basic consideration for
   this casualness.  In a potential practice, MAP-E and MAP-T would not
   only coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other
   deployment cases.  Here lists some coexisting cases.  (Note: more
   coexisting cases are expected to be investigated in future.)

   o  Case 1: Coexisting between MAP Encapsulation(MAP-E) and MAP
      Translation(MAP-T)

   o  Case 2: Coexisting between MAP translation(Double Translation) and
      NAT64 (Single Translation)

   o  Case3: Coexisting between MAP-based solution and native IPv6
      deployement

   Regarding the case 1, MAP[I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port]
   has provided a good pre-condition, in which a unified address format
   and configuration rules have been documented to facilitate the
   collocation of MAP-T and MAP-E.  Received date packages on CE or BR
   could be differentiated and processed accordingly through inspecting
   "Next Header" filed in IP header.

   Regarding the case 2, separated gateway on the ISP network edge may



Chen, et al.             Expires August 2, 2012                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               MAP Deployment                 January 2012


   serve MAP BR and NAT64 respectively.  In alternative case, MAP BR or
   NAT64 functionality could be configured on the different interfaces
   on a standalone gateway.  In either case, traffic could be
   distributed into proper gateway or interface by addressing diffrent
   IPv6 prefix as NAT4prefix and Rule IPv6 prefix.

   Regarding the case 3, MAP solutions would not eliminate IPv6 host
   accessing MAP CE.  Native IPv6 communication should get along with
   MAP solution.  RFC6204 shoud be applied to CE in this case.  Prefix
   delegation has two-fold, in which delegated prefix would not only
   help to create unique, longer IPv6 prefixes for IPv6 hosts, but also
   serve MAP algorithm to implicitly derive shared IPv4 address/port
   information.  When data packages have been received at CE, it would
   distinguish IPv4 packets from native IPv6 packets depending on
   preconfigured mapping rules.

6.1.3.  Exit Strategy

   The benefits of IPv6 + MAP-based solution are that all IPv6 flows
   would go directly to the Internet, no need further progressing on
   encapsulation or translation.  In this way, as more content providers
   and service are available over IPv6, the utilization on MAP CE and BR
   goes down since fewer destinations require MAP progressing.  This way
   would advance IPv6, because it provides everyone incentives to use
   IPv6, and eventually the result is an pure IPv6 network with no need
   for IPv4.  As more content providers and hosts equiped with IPv6
   capabilities , the MAP utilization goes down until it is eventually
   not used at all when all content is IPv6.  In this way, MAP has an
   "exit strategy".  The corresponding solutions will leave the network
   in time.

6.2.  Migration Mode

   IPv4 Residual deployment is a interim phase during IPv6 migration.
   It would be beneficial for ISPs, if this phase is as short as
   possible since end-to-end IPv6 traversal is the really goals.  When
   IPv6 is getting more and more mature, MAP solution would be retired
   in a natural way or enforced by particular considerations.

6.2.1.  Passive Transition

   Passive Transition is following IPv4 retirement law.  In another
   word, MAP would always get along with IPv4 appearance, even all nodes
   is dual-stack capable.  At a later stage of IPv6 migration, MAP based
   solutions can also be served for dual-stack hosts, which is sending
   traffic through the IPv4 stack.  There is still a value for this
   approach because it could steer IPv4 traffic to IPv6 going through a
   MAP CE processing.  When it comes the time when ISP decide to turn

   off IPv4, MAP would be faded due to IPv4 disappearance.

6.2.2.  Active Transition

   Active Transition is targeting to acclerate IPv4 exit and increase
   native IPv6 utilization.  A desirable way deploying MAP solution is
   only providing IPv6 traversal ability to a IPv4-only host.  However,
   MAP CE can not determine received traffic is send from a IPv4 node or
   a dual-stack node.  In the latter case, IPv6 utilization is prefered
   in a common case.  When a network evolve to a post-IPv6 era.  It
   might be good for ISP to consider implement enforcements rules to
   help IPv6 migration.  There is a set of approach would help the
   situation.

   o  ISP could install only IPv6 record (i.e.  AAAA) in DNS server,
      which would provide users with IPv6 steering effects.  When a host
      is IPv6-capable and gets IPv6 DNS reply in advance, MAP
      functionalities would be restricted by IPv6-only record reply

   o  ISP could retrieve shared IPv4 address by increasing sharing
      ratio.  In this case, number of concurrent IPv4 sessions on MAP CE
      would be suppressed.  It would encourage native IPv6 growth in
      some extent.

   o  ISP could allocate a dedicated IPv6 prefix for MAP deployment.
      The allocation could not only facilitate the differentiation
      between MAPed traffic and native IPv6 trafffic, but also clearly
      observe the tendency of MAP traffic.  When the traffic is getting
      down for while, ISP could close the MAP functionalities in some
      specific area.  It would result networks to native IPv6-only
      capable.

7.  === OLD TEXT === Deployment Considerations

7.1.  Flexible Assigment of Port Sets

   Different classes of customers require port sets of different size.
   In the context of shared IPv4 addresses, some customers would be
   satisfied with an shared IPv4 addresses, while others may need to be
   assigned a single IPv4 address or delegated an IPv4 subnet.

7.2.  Traffic Classification

   Usually, ISPs adopt traffic classification to ensure service quality
   for different classes of customers.  This feature is also helpful for
   customer behavior monitoring and security protection.  For example,
   DIA (Dedicated Internet Access) has been provided by operators for
   corporations to cater for their Internet communications needs.
   Service is made by means of the edge router features and key systems,
   like ACL (Access List Control) to classify different traffic.  Five
   tuples would be identified from IP header and UDP/TCP header.
   Currently, it is very well supported in IPv4.  Vendors are delivering
   or committed to support that feature for IPv6.  In order to
   facilitating IPv6 deployment, MAP solution should support this
   feature on IPv6 plane.

7.3.  Prefix Delegation Deployment

   Prefix delegation is an important feature both for broadband and
   mobile network.  In mobile network, prefix delegation is introduced
   in 3GPP network in Release 10.  The deployment of PD would be
   supported in 4v6 case.  Variable length of IPv6 prefix is assigned to
   CPE for deriving IPv4 information.

7.4.  Coexisting Deployment

   4v6 solutions(i.e. encapsulation and translation) would not only
   coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other deployment
   cases.  Here lists some coexisting cases.  (Note: more coexisting
   cases are expected to be investigated in future.)

   o Case 1: Coexisting between 4v6 encapsulation and 4v6 translation

   o Case 2: Coexisting between 4v6 translation and NAT64 (Single
   Translation)

   o Case 3: Coexisting between 4v6 solutions and SLAAC

7.5.  Friendly to Network Provisioning

   Network management plane normally has an ability to to identify
   different users and the compatible with the address assignment
   techniques in the domain. 4v6 would conform to current practices on
   management plane.  In 3GPP network, for example, only the IPv6 prefix
   is assigned to the devices, used to identify different users.  And
   management plane for one family address is better than two, namely
   the operating platform does not need to manage both IPv4 and IPv6.
   Since only IPv6 prefix is assigned, 4v6 on the management plane is
   naturally conducted only via IPv6.

7.6.  Enable privacy addresses

   User privacy should be taken into account when 4v6 solution is
   deployed.  Some security concern associated with non-changing IPv6
   interface identifiers has been expressed in RFC4941[RFC4941].
   Ability to change the interface identifier over time makes it more
   difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to
   identify when different addresses used in different sessions actually
   correspond to the same node.

7.7.  Facilitating 4v6 Service

   Some ISPs may need to offer services in a 4v6 domain with a shared
   address, e.g. 4v6 node hosts FTP server.  The service provisioning
   may require well-know port range(i.e. port range belong to 0-1023).
   MAP would provide operators with possibilities to generate a port
   range including the 0-1023.  Afterwards, operators could decide to
   assign it to any requesting user.

7.8.  Independency with IPv6 Routing Planning

   The IPv6 routing is easier to plan if it's not impacted by the
   encoded IPv4 or port ID information.  MAP would prohibit IPv4 routing
   imported in IPv6.

7.9.  Optimized Routing Path

   MAP could achieve optimized routing path both for hub case and mesh
   case.  Traffic in hub and spoke case could follow asymmetric routing,
   in which incoming routes would not be binded to a given border point
   but others geographically closed to traffic initiators.  In mesh
   cases, traffic between CPEs could directly communicate without going
   through remote border point.

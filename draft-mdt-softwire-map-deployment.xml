    <abstract>

      softwire is Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) for the IPv4 residual
      deployment in the IPv6-dominant domain.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv4 address exhaustion has becoming world-wide reality and the main
      stream of deployment since now on is IPv6-only networking. Meanwhile,
      having access to legacy IPv4 contents and services is a long-term
      requirement, lasting until the completion of the IPv6 transition. It
      demands sharing residual IPv4 address pools for IPv4 communications
      across the IPv6-only domain(s).</t>

      <t>Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) <xref
      target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref> is designed
      in response to the requirement of stateless residual deployment. The
      term "residual deployment" refers to utilizing not-yet-assigned or
      recalled IPv4 addresses for IPv4 communications going across the IPv6
      domain backbone. MAP assumes the IPv6-only backbone as the prerequisite
      of deployment so that native IPv6 services and applications are fully
      supported and encouraged. The statelessness of MAP ensures only moderate
      overhead is added to part of the network devices.</t>

      <t>Residual deployment with MAP is new to most operators. This document
      is motivated to provide basic understanding on the usage of MAP, i.e.,
      when and how an operator can do with MAP to meet its own operational
      requirements of IPv6 transition and its facility conditions, in the
      phase of IPv4 residual deployment. Potential readers of this document
      are those who want to know: <list style="numbers">
          <t>What kind of deployment requirements does MAP satisfy?</t>

          <t>What technical options needs to be considered when deploying MAP,
          and how?</t>

          <t>How does MAP impact on the address planning for both IPv6 and
          IPv4 pools?</t>

          <t>How does MAP impact on daily network operations and
          administrations?</t>

          <t>How do we migrate to IPv6-only network with the help of MAP?</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>MAP is suitable for deployment either in large-scale carrier (fixed)
      networks or in mobile networks. They have similar but different
      requirements.</t>

      <!-- SUBSECTION: FIXED NETWORKS, Qiong -->

      <section title="Fixed networks">
<t>There are typically two network models for fixed broadband access service: one is to access using PPPoE/PPPoA authentication method while the other is to use IPoE. The first one is usually applied to Residential network and SOHO networks. Subscribers in CPNs can access broadband network by PPP dial-up authentication. BRAS is the key network element which takes full responsibility of IP address assignment, user authentication, traffic aggregation, PPP session termination, etc. Then IP traffic is forwarded to Core Routers through Metro Area Network, and finally transited to external Internet via Backbone network.The second network scenario is usually applied to large enterprise networks. Subscribers in CPNs can access broadband network by IPoE authentication. IP address is normally assigned by DHCP server, or static configuration. </t>
<t>In either case, a CPE could obtain a prefix via prefix delegation procedure, and the hosts behind CPE would get its own IPv6 addresses within the prefix through SLAAC or DHCPv6 stateful. A MAP CE would also obtain a set of MAP rules from DHCPv6 server. In MAP solution, both encapsulation and double translation can be applied. </t>

      <!-- SUBSECTION: MOBILE NETWORKS, Gang -->

      <section title="Mobile networks">
        <t>Regarding the MAP based solution, double translation is more
        suitable in mobile environment according to the analysis in stateless
        4V6<xref target="I-D.dec-stateless-4v6"></xref>. An architecture of
        mobile network deploying MAP-based solutions is depicted in <xref
        target="I-D.chen-softwire-4v6-pd"></xref>. UE could take the rule of
        MAP CE. There may be three possible cases for a UE performing as a MAP
        CE. As shown in Figure 1. It provides IPv4 only, IPv6 only or IPv6 and
        IPv4 connection to IP devices depicted as H1, H2 and H3. The MAP CE
        may implement a internal NAT44 to provide IPv4 connectin for multiple
        IP devices. The IP devices get /64 prefix from MAP CE through RS/RA.
        Such a /64 prefix is generated from the prefix assigned by the network
        through prefix delegation. In the process, IPv6 prefix delegation is
        asked to derive the shared IPv4 address implicitly. </t>

        <t>Prefix delegation is introduced in 3GPP network in Release 10. A
        MAP CE obtains IPv6 prefix from the mobile network. It then initiates
        DHCPv6 for prefix delegation. There are two phases for a MAP CE
        performs prefix delegation function. For the first phase, the MAP CE
        attaches to the LTE network. The network provides the UE with IPv6
        only connection and the UE obtains a /64 rule IPv6 prefix. For the
        second phase, the MAP CE initiates prefix delegation procedure. The
        network assign a prefix shorter than 64 to the CE. Figure 1 shows a
        case that a /56 is assigned to MAP CE during prefix delegation. </t>

    <!--  SECTION 4: DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS, Qiong  -->

    <section title="Deployment Consideration">
	
      <section title="Building the MAP domain">
      	
		<t>When deploying stateless MAP in operational network, a provider should firstly do MAP domain planning based on its own network condition. According to the definition of  <xref target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref>, a MAP domain is a set of MAP CEs and BRs connected to the same virtual link. One MAP domain share a common BR and have the same set of BMRs, FMRs and DMR, and it can be further divided into multiple sub-domains when multiple IPv4 subnets are deployed in one MAP domain. All CEs in MAP domain are provisioned with the same set of MAP rules by MAP DHCPv6 server <xref target="I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option"></xref>. There might be multiple BMRs in one MAP domain, and CE would pick up its own BMR by best prefix matching lookup. However, all CEs within the sub-domain will have the same BMR. in which the BMR of all CEs is the same. In hub&spoke mode, CE would use DMR as its only FMR for outbound traffic; while in mesh mode, a best matching prefix lookup is done in the IPv4 routing tabe and the correct FMR is chosen.</t>
		<t>Basically, operator should firstly determine its own deployment mode for MAP domain: mesh or Hub &spoke, as different considerations for different deployment models should be applied accordingly. Afterwards, MAP domain planning, MAP rule provision, addressing and routing, etc., for a MAP domain should be taken into consideration.</t>
		
		<section title="Mesh vs. Hub/Spoke">
		<t>Only Hub/spoke communications can be achieved among CEs located different MAP domains. Mesh or Hub/Spoke communications can be achieved among CEs in one MAP domain in terms of assigning appropriate Forwarding Mapping Rule(s) (FMR(s)) to CEs. </t> 
          <t>It is note that Default Mapping Rule (DMR) must be assigned to all CEs in MAP domain as FMR or one of FMRs.</t>
		  <t>The decision to choose Mesh or Hub&Spoke depends on operator's network policy. In Hub&Spoke mode, all traffic within the same MAP domain has to go through BR which will result in less optimized traffic; however, it would simplify the CE process since there is no need to do FMR lookup for each incoming packet. Besides, it would have enhanced management ability as BR can take full control of all the traffic. As a result, it is reasonable to deploy Hub&Spoke mode for network with relatively flat architecture. </t>
		  <t>In mesh mode, traffic optimization can be achieved by CE to CE direct path. It is recommended to apply mesh mode in case CE to CE traffic occupies a large amount and there are not too many MAP rules, say less than 10 MAP rules, in the specific domain.</t>
          <section title="Only Hub/Spoke Communication among CEs">
            <t>Only assigning DMR to all CEs as FMR, Hub&Spoke communication can be achieved between all CEs.  In this mode, when CE send packets to other CE in the same MAP domain, the packets must go though BR before arriving the peer.</t>
          </section>
          
          <section title="Only Mesh Communication among CEs">
            <t>Assigning all BMRs in MAP domain to each CE as FMRs, Mesh communications can be achieved among all CEs.  In this case, when CE receive IPv4 packets, it looks up appropriate FMR with a specific Rule IPv4 prefix which has the longest match with an IPv4 destination address.  If the FMR is found (destination is one of CEs in the MAP domain), the packets will be forwarded to associated CE directly without going though BR. If the FMR is no found (destination is out of the MAP domain), the DMR will be selected as FMR, then forward the packets to associated BR(s).</t>
          </section>
          
          <section title="Mesh or Hub/Spoke communication among some CEs (title? TBD)">
            <t>Mesh communications among some CEs along with Hub/Spoke communications among some other CEs can be achieved by which differentiated FMRs are assigned to CEs. For instant, as <xref target="MESH-HUB-EXA"></xref> shown, Mapping rule 1, Mapping rule 2, Mapping rule 3 is provisioned to CE1, CE2, CE3 respectively as BMR, DMR and rule 1 and rule2, DMR and rule 1 and rule 2 and rule 3, DMR and rule 2 and rule 3 are assigned to CE1, CE2, CE3 respectively, then CE1 and CE2, CE2 and CE3 communicate directly without going though associated BR (Mesh mode), the communication between CE1 and CE3 must go though BR before reaching peer each other (Hub/Spoke mode).</t>

        <section title="MAP domain planning">
		  <t>Stateless MAP has its own advantage in terms of scalability, high-reliability, etc. As a result, it is reasonable to apply a larger MAP domain to accomodate more subscribers with less BRs. Moreover, a larger MAP domain would also be easier for management and maintainace. However, a larger MAP domain may also result in less optimized traffic in Hub & spoke case, where all traffic has to go through a remote BR. Besides, it will also result in increased number of MAP rules and highly centralized address mangement, etc. It is a tradeoff to choose an appropriate domain coverage.</t>
		  <t>Generally speaking, it is not recommended to use a large MAP domain in Hub & spoke model. While in mesh model, it is suggested to adopt a relatively larger MAP domain since traffic optimization has already been guaranteed, and the only concern is to make sure that the number of MAP rules is not too many.</t>
		  <t>Furthermore, MAP sub-domains can be divided for differentiated service provision. Different sub-domains could be distinguished by different Rule IPv4 prefixes. But all CEs within the same MAP sub-domain would have the same Rule IPv4 prefix, Rule IPv6 prefix and PSID. </t>

        <section title="MAP rule provisioning">
         <t>All the CEs within a MAP domain will get the same set of MAP rules by DHCPv6 server, including BMR, FMRs and DMR. In one MAP domian, BMR for different CEs might be different, but FMRs and DMR are all the same. Each Mapping Rule keeps a record of Rule IPv6 prefix, Rule IPv4 prefix, Rule EA-bits length and Rule Port Parameters. Section XX would give a step by step example of how to calculate these parameters. </t>
		 <t>In stateless MAP, the deployment of DHCPv6 server is independent with MAP domain planning. So there are three possible ways: </t>
		 <section title="MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = 1:1">
		 <t>This is the ideal solution that each MAP domain would have its own MAP DHCPv6 server. In this case, MAP DHCPv6 server only needs to configure parameters for the specific MAP domain. It is highly recommended to adopt this deployment model in stateless MAP. </t>
		 </section>
		 <section title="MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = 1:N">
		 <t>This might happen when DHCPv6 server is distributely deployed in a large MAP domain. In this case, all these DHCPv6 server should configure the same set of MAP rules for its MAP domain, including mutiple BMRs, FMRs and DMR.</t>
		 </section>
		 <section title="MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = N:1">
		 <t>This might happen when MAP domain is relatively small and MAP DHCPv6 server is deployed centralized in the network. It would be complicated since DHCPv6 server needs to distinguish between different MAP domains and assign appropriate MAP rules for CEs. It is not suggested to use this deployment model unless there are easy way, e.g. ACL, etc., to identify different MAP domains. </t>
		 <t>Discussion: Is there some possible easy way to idenfity different MAP domains ? </t>
		 </section>
	
	<t>Besides, the situation of remaining IPv4 address prefixes may have big impact on MAP rule planning, especially for service operators who only have rather scattered address space. Since the number of scattered IPv4 address prefixes would be equal to the number of FMR rules within a MAP domain, one should choose as large IPv4 address pool as possible to reduce the number of FMR rules.</t>

        <section title="PSID consideration">
          <t>For PSID provnisioning, all the CEs, BR and DHCPv6 server within the same MAP domain should be configured with the same parameter value. All CEs with the same BMR should have the same PSID length. If a provider would like to introduce differentiated address sharing ratios for different CEs, it is better to define multiple MAP sub-domains with different Rule IPv4 prefixes. In this way, MAP domain division is only a logical method, rather than a geographical one.</t> 
		  <t> The default PSID offset is chosen as 4 in <xref target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref>, which will exclude port range of 0-4096. Operator can adjust the value follow practical usage in reality.</t>
		  <t>With regard to PSID format, both continous and non-continuous port set can be supported in GMA algorithm. Although non-continuous port set has the advantage of better security, UPnP friendly, etc., continuous port set is still the simplest way to implement. Since PSID format should be supported not only in CPEs, BRs and DHCPv6 server, but also in other supporting systems as well, e.g. traffic logging system, user management system, a provider should make the decision based on an comprehensive analysis on its own existing systems. </t>

      <section title="BR settings">
        <t>1. BR placement</t>

		<t>BR placement has important impacts on the operation of a MAP domain.</t>

        <t>A first concern should be the avoidance of "triangle routing". That is, the path from the CE to an IPv4 peer via the BR should be close to the one that would be taken if the CE had native IPv4 connectivity. This can be accomplished easily by placing the BR close to the CE, such that the length of the path from the CE to the BR is minimized.</t>

        <t>However, minimizing the CE-BR path would ignore a second concern, that of minimizing IPv4 operations. An ISP deploying MAP will probably want to focus on IPv6 operations, while keeping IPv4 operational expenditures to a minimum. This would imply that the size of the IPv4 network that the ISP has to administer would be kept to a minimum. Placing the BR near the CE means that the length of the IPv4 network between the BR and the IPv4 Internet would be maximal.</t>
        
		<t>Moreover, in case where the set of CEs is geographically dispersed, multiple BRs would be needed, which would further enlarge the IPv4 network that the ISP has to maintain.</t>

        <t>Therefore, we offer the following guideline: BRs should be placed as close to the border with the IPv4 Internet as possible while keeping triangle routing to a minimum. Regional POPs should probably be considered as potential candidates.</t>

        <t>Note also that MAP being stateless, asymmetric routing is possible, meaning that separate BRs can be used for traffic entering and exiting a MAP domain.  This option can be considered for its effects on traffic engineering.</t>

        <t>Anycast can be used to let the network pick BR closest to a CE for traffic exiting the MAP domain. This is accomplished by provisioning a Default Mapping Rule containing an anycast IPv6 address or prefix. Operationally, this allows incremental deployment of BRs in strategic locations without modifying the provisioning system's configuration. CE's close to a newly-deployed BR will automatically start using it.</t>


        <t>2. Reliability Considerations</t>

		
        <t>Reliability of MAP is derived in major part from its statelessness. This means that MAP can benefit from the usual methods of Internet reliability.</t>

        <t>Anycast, already mentioned in section 4.2.1, can be used to ensure reliability of traffic from CE to BR. Since there can be only one Default Mapping Rule per MAP domain, traffic from CE to BR will always use the same destination address (in encapsulation mode) or prefix (in translation mode).  When this is address or prefix is anycast, reliability is greatly increased. If a BR goes down, it stops advertising the IPv6 anycast address or prefix, and traffic is automatically re-routed to other BRs. For this mechanism to work correctly, it is crucial that the anycast route announcement be very closely tied to BR availability. See [RFC4786] for best current practices on the operation of anycast services. </t>

        <t>Anycast covers global reliability. Reliability within a single link can be achieved with the help of a redundancy protocol such as VRRP [RFC5798]. This allows operation of a pair of BRs in active/standby configuration. No state needs to be shared for the operation of MAP, so there is no need to keep the standby node in a "warm" state: as long as it is up and ready to take over the virtual IPv6 address, quick failover can be achieved. This makes the pair behave as a single, much more reliable node, with less reliance on quick routing protocol convergence for reliability.</t>

        <t>It is expected that production-quality MAP deployments will make use of both anycast and a redundancy protocol such as VRRP.</t>

        <t>3. MTU/Fragmentation</t>

        <t>If the MTU is well-managed such that the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs within the boundary of the MAP domain, then the 4rd Tunnel MTU can be set to the known IPv6 MTU minus the size of the encapsulating IPv6 header (40 bytes).  For example, if the IPv6 MTU is known to be 1500 bytes, the 4rd Tunnel MTU might be set to 1460 bytes.  Absent more specific information, the 4rd Tunnel MTU SHOULD default to 1280 bytes.</t>

        <t>When using encapsulation mode, it is important that fragments of a MAP packet sent according to the Default Mapping Rule be handled by the same BR.  (This is not required for translation mode.) This can be a problem when using an anycast BR address and routing fluctuations cause fragments of a packet to be routed to multiple BRs.</t>

        <t>BRs using an anycast address as source can cause problems. If traffic sent by a BR with a source anycast address causes an ICMP error to be returned, that error packet's destination address will be an anycast address, meaning that a different BR could receive it. In the case of a Too Big ICMP error, this could cause a path MTU discovery black hole. Another possible problem could occur if fragmented packets from different BRs using the same anycast address as source happen to contain the same fragment ID. This would break fragment reassembly.</t>
        <t>Therefore, when using anycast addresses, it is RECOMMENDED that they be only used as destination addresses, and never as source addresses. BRs SHOULD be configured to accept traffic sent to the anycast address, but use an unicast address as source.</t>

        <t>In MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are not shared, IPv6 destinations are derived from IPv4 addresses alone.  Thus, each IPv4 packet can be encapsulated and decapsulated independently of each other. 4rd processing is completely stateless.</t>

        <t>On the other hand, in MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are shared, BRs and CEs may have to encapsulate or translate IPv4 packets whose IPv6 destinations depend on destination ports.  Precautions are needed, due to the fact that the destination port of a fragmented datagram is available only in its first fragment.  A sufficient precaution consists in reassembling each datagram received in multiple packets, and to treat it as though it would have been received in single packet.  This function is such that MAP is in this case stateful at the IP layer.  (This is common with DS-lite and NAT64/DNS64 which, in addition, are stateful at the transport layer.)  At domain entrance, this ensures that all pieces of all received IPv4 datagrams go to the right IPv6 destinations.</t>

        <t>Another peculiarity of shared IPv4 addresses is that, without precaution, a destination could simultaneously receive from different sources fragmented datagrams that have the same Datagram ID (the Identification field of [RFC0791]).  This would disturb the reassembly process.  To eliminate this risk, CE MUST rewrite the datagram ID to a unique value among CEs sharing an IPv4 address upon sending the packet over a MAP domain.  This value SHOULD be generated locally within the port-range assigned to a given CE.  Note that replacing a Datagram ID in an IPv4 header implies an update of its Header-checksum field, by adding to it the one's complement difference between the old and the new values.</t>

      <section title="CE settings">

        <t>1. bridging vs. routing mode</t>

        <t>In routing mode, the CE runs a standard NAT44 [RFC3022] using the allocated public
   address as external IP and ports via DHCPv6 option.  When receiving an IPv4 packet with
   private source address from its end hosts, it performs NAT44 function
   by translating the source address into public and selecting a port
   from the allocated port-set.  Then it encapsulates/translates the packet with
   the concentrator's IPv6 address as destination IPv6 address, and
   forwards it to the concentrator.  When receiving an IPv6
   packet from the concentrator, the initiator decapsulates/translates the IPv6
   packet to get the IPv4 packet with public destination IPv4 address.
   Then it performs NAT44 function and translates the destination
   address into private. </t>

        <t>The CE is responsible for performing ALG functions (e.g., SIP, FTP),
   as well as supporting NAT Traversal mechanisms (e.g., UPnP, NAT-PMP,
   manual mapping configuration).  This is no different from the
   standard IPv4 NAT today.</t>

       <t>For the bridging mode, end host would run a software performing CE functionalities. In this case, end host gets public address directly.
   It is also suggested that the host run a local NAT to map randomly
   generated ports into the restricted, valid port-set.  Another
   solution is to have the IP stack to only assign ports within the
   restricted, valid range to applications.  Either way the host
   guarantees that every source port number in the outgoing packets
   falls into the allocated port-set.
</t>

        <t>2. CE-initiated application</t>

        <t>CE-initiated case is applied for situations where applications run on CE directly. If the application in CE use the public address directly, it might conflict with other CEs. So it is highly suggested that CE should also run a local NAT to map a private address to public address in CE. In this way, the CE IPv4 address passed to local applications would be conflict with other CEs. Moreover, CE should guarantee that every source port number in the outgoing packets falls into the allocated port-set.</t>

      <section title="Supporting system">
        <t>1. Lawful Intercept</t>
Sharing IPv4 addresses among multiple CEs is susceptible to issues related to
lawful intercept. For details, see [RFC6269] section 12.
        <t></t>

        <t>2. Traffic Logging</t>
It is always possible for a service provider that operates a MAP domain to determine the IPv6 prefix associated with a MAP IPv4 address (and port number in case of a shared address). This mapping is static, and it is therefore unnecessary to log every IPv4 address assignment. However, changes in that static mapping, such as rule changes in the provisioning system, need to be logged in order to be able to know the mapping at any point in time.

Sharing IPv4 addresses among multiple CEs is susceptible to issues related to traffic logging. For details, see [RFC6269] sections 8 and 13.1.
        <t></t>

        <t>3. Geo-location aware service</t>
Sharing IPv4 addresses among multiple CEs is susceptible to issues related to geo-location. For details, see [RFC6269] section 7.

        <t></t>

        <t>4. User Managment (policy control ,etc ... )</t>

MAP IPv4 address assignment, and hence the IPv4 service itself, is tied to the IPv6 prefix lease; thus, the MAP service is also tied to this in terms of authorization, accounting, etc.  For example, the MAP address has the same lifetime as its associated IPv6 prefix.

          <t hangText="">In our example, let's take k = 0 for simplicity.</t>

      <t>(B) IPv4 considerations</t>

          <t hangText="">If we use both blocks, M = 2^16 + 2^16, and therefore

      <t>Remarks:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>IPv6 address planning in residual deployment is independent of
          the usage of the residual IPv4 addresses.</t>

          <t>The IPv4 address pool for "residual deployment" contains IPv4
          addresses not yet assigned to customers/subscribers and/or those
          already recalled from ex-customers. Dynamic assignment is also

          <t>MAP is mainly designed for residual deployment but also applied

          once a single rule applies for the whole IPv4 space, MAP-format
          becomes equivalent to RFC6052-format. This frees the domain to

          <t>IPv6 deployment normally involves a step-wise approach where
          parts of the network should properly updated gradually. As IPv6
          deployment progresses it may be simpler for operators to employ a
          single-version network, since deploying both IPv4 and IPv6 in
          parallel would costs more than IPv6-only network. Therefore
          switching to an IPv6-only network in realtively small scale will
          become more prevalent. Meanwhile, a significant part of network will
          still stay in IPv4 for long time, especially at early stage of IPv6
          transition. There may not be enough public or private IPv4 addresses
          to support end-to-end network communication, without segmenting the
          network into small parts with sharing one IPv4 address space. That

          configuration rules have been documented to facilitate the
          collocation of MAP-T and MAP-E. Received date packages on CE or BR
          could be differentiated and processed accordingly through inspecting
          "Next Header" filed in IP header.</t>

          <t>Regarding the case 2, separated gateway on the ISP network edge
          may serve MAP BR and NAT64 respectively. In alternative case, MAP BR
          or NAT64 functionality could be configured on the different
          interfaces on a standalone gateway. In either case, traffic could be
          distributed into proper gateway or interface by addressing diffrent
          IPv6 prefix as NAT4prefix and Rule IPv6 prefix.</t>

          <t>Regarding the case 3, MAP solutions would not eliminate IPv6 host
          accessing MAP CE. Native IPv6 communication should get along with
          MAP solution. RFC6204  shoud be applied
          to CE in this case. Prefix delegation has two-fold, in which
          delegated prefix would not only help to create unique, longer IPv6
          prefixes for IPv6 hosts, but also serve MAP algorithm to implicitly
          derive shared IPv4 address/port information. When data packages have
          been received at CE, it would distinguish IPv4 packets from native
          IPv6 packets depending on preconfigured mapping rules.</t>

        <section title="Exit Strategy ">
          <t>The benefits of IPv6 + MAP-based solution are that all IPv6 flows
          would go directly to the Internet, no need further progressing on
          encapsulation or translation. In this way, as more content providers
          and service are available over IPv6, the utilization on MAP CE and
          BR goes down since fewer destinations require MAP progressing. This
          way would advance IPv6, because it provides everyone incentives to
          use IPv6, and eventually the result is an pure IPv6 network with no
          need for IPv4. As more content providers and hosts equiped with IPv6
          capabilities , the MAP utilization goes down until it is eventually
          not used at all when all content is IPv6. In this way, MAP has an
          "exit strategy". The corresponding solutions will leave the network
          in time.</t>

      <section title="Migration Mode">
        <t>IPv4 Residual deployment is a interim phase during IPv6 migration.
        It would be beneficial for ISPs, if this phase is as short as possible
        since end-to-end IPv6 traversal is the really goals. When IPv6 is
        getting more and more mature, MAP solution would be retired in a
        natural way or enforced by particular considerations.</t>

        <section title="Passive Transition">
          <t>Passive Transition is following IPv4 retirement law. In another
          word, MAP would always get along with IPv4 appearance, even all
          nodes is dual-stack capable. At a later stage of IPv6 migration, MAP
          based solutions can also be served for dual-stack hosts, which is
          sending traffic through the IPv4 stack. There is still a value for
          this approach because it could steer IPv4 traffic to IPv6 going
          through a MAP CE processing. When it comes the time when ISP decide
          to turn off IPv4, MAP would be faded due to IPv4 disappearance.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Active Transition">
          <t>Active Transition is targeting to acclerate IPv4 exit and
          increase native IPv6 utilization. A desirable way deploying MAP
          solution is only providing IPv6 traversal ability to a IPv4-only
          host. However, MAP CE can not determine received traffic is send
          from a IPv4 node or a dual-stack node. In the latter case, IPv6
          utilization is prefered in a common case. When a network evolve to a
          post-IPv6 era. It might be good for ISP to consider implement
          enforcements rules to help IPv6 migration. There is a set of
          approach would help the situation.</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>ISP could install only IPv6 record (i.e. AAAA) in DNS server,
              which would provide users with IPv6 steering effects. When a
              host is IPv6-capable and gets IPv6 DNS reply in advance, MAP
              functionalities would be restricted by IPv6-only record
              reply</t>

              <t>ISP could retrieve shared IPv4 address by increasing sharing
              ratio. In this case, number of concurrent IPv4 sessions on MAP
              CE would be suppressed. It would encourage native IPv6 growth in
              some extent.</t>

              <t>ISP could allocate a dedicated IPv6 prefix for MAP
              deployment. The allocation could not only facilitate the
              differentiation between MAPed traffic and native IPv6 trafffic,
              but also clearly observe the tendency of MAP traffic. When the
              traffic is getting down for while, ISP could close the MAP
              functionalities in some specific area. It would result networks
              to native IPv6-only capable.</t>

    <section title="=== OLD TEXT === Deployment Considerations">
      <section title="Flexible Assigment of Port Sets">
        <t>Different classes of customers require port sets of different size.
        In the context of shared IPv4 addresses, some customers would be
        satisfied with an shared IPv4 addresses, while others may need to be
        assigned a single IPv4 address or delegated an IPv4 subnet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Traffic Classification">
        <t>Usually, ISPs adopt traffic classification to ensure service
        quality for different classes of customers. This feature is also
        helpful for customer behavior monitoring and security protection. For
        example, DIA (Dedicated Internet Access) has been provided by
        operators for corporations to cater for their Internet communications
        needs. Service is made by means of the edge router features and key
        systems, like ACL (Access List Control) to classify different traffic.
        Five tuples would be identified from IP header and UDP/TCP header.
        Currently, it is very well supported in IPv4. Vendors are delivering
        or committed to support that feature for IPv6. In order to
        facilitating IPv6 deployment, MAP solution should support this feature
        on IPv6 plane.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Prefix Delegation Deployment">
        <t>Prefix delegation is an important feature both for broadband and
        mobile network. In mobile network, prefix delegation is introduced in
        3GPP network in Release 10. The deployment of PD would be supported in
        4v6 case. Variable length of IPv6 prefix is assigned to CPE for
        deriving IPv4 information.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Coexisting Deployment">
        <t>4v6 solutions(i.e. encapsulation and translation) would not only
        coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other deployment
        cases. Here lists some coexisting cases. (Note: more coexisting cases
        are expected to be investigated in future.)</t>

        <t>o Case 1: Coexisting between 4v6 encapsulation and 4v6
        translation</t>

        <t>o Case 2: Coexisting between 4v6 translation and NAT64 (Single
        Translation)</t>

        <t>o Case 3: Coexisting between 4v6 solutions and SLAAC</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Friendly to Network Provisioning">
        <t>Network management plane normally has an ability to to identify
        different users and the compatible with the address assignment
        techniques in the domain. 4v6 would conform to current practices on
        management plane. In 3GPP network, for example, only the IPv6 prefix
        is assigned to the devices, used to identify different users. And
        management plane for one family address is better than two, namely the
        operating platform does not need to manage both IPv4 and IPv6. Since
        only IPv6 prefix is assigned, 4v6 on the management plane is naturally
        conducted only via IPv6.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Enable privacy addresses">
        <t>User privacy should be taken into account when 4v6 solution is
        deployed. Some security concern associated with non-changing IPv6
        interface identifiers has been expressed in RFC4941[RFC4941]. Ability
        to change the interface identifier over time makes it more difficult
        for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when
        different addresses used in different sessions actually correspond to
        the same node.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Facilitating 4v6 Service">
        <t>Some ISPs may need to offer services in a 4v6 domain with a shared
        address, e.g. 4v6 node hosts FTP server. The service provisioning may
        require well-know port range(i.e. port range belong to 0-1023). MAP
        would provide operators with possibilities to generate a port range
        including the 0-1023. Afterwards, operators could decide to assign it
        to any requesting user.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Independency with IPv6 Routing Planning">
        <t>The IPv6 routing is easier to plan if it's not impacted by the
        encoded IPv4 or port ID information. MAP would prohibit IPv4 routing
        imported in IPv6.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Optimized Routing Path">
        <t>MAP could achieve optimized routing path both for hub case and mesh
        case. Traffic in hub and spoke case could follow asymmetric routing,
        in which incoming routes would not be binded to a given border point
        but others geographically closed to traffic initiators. In mesh cases,
        traffic between CPEs could directly communicate without going through
        remote border point.</t>
